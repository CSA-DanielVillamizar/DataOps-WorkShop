# A gentle introduction to AI on Azure

## Workshop Source 

This workshop collects all the material used for the Reactor session [*What is all the hype about? A gentle introduction to AI on Azure in 2023*](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/reactor/events/19156/?WT.mc_id=academic-97358-cacaste).

The source of the demo included in the workshop is the [Azure Search OpenAI demo](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo) GitHub repo.

## Stage 1: Desired Results 

1. Learners will be skilled at:
    -  Understanding how generative AI models work and their main capabilities;
    -  Understanding what Azure OpenAI service is and how it is placed in the Azure AI platform;
    -  Identifying generative AI models limits and the tools at our disposal to mitigate them and to use AI responsibly.

2. They will be able to independently use their learning to:
    -  Integrating generative AI into their apps, by combining Azure OpenAI service with other Azure services into a single solution to unlock new scenarios.

## Stage 2: Evidence

Learners will demonstrate their understanding of the concepts by doing the following:
 
1. Working through the [demo included in this workshop](./solution/README.md) and trying to replicate it on their own Azure subscription.
2. Completing [this quiz](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/training/modules/explore-azure-openai/9-knowledge-check/?WT.mc_id=academic-97358-cacaste) on Microsoft Learn.

## Stage 3: Learning Plan

* Milestone 1: What's behind the AI media hype
* Milestone 2: How a Large Language Model works
* Milestone 3: OpenAI + Microsoft = Azure OpenAI service
* Milestone 4: Integrating generative AI into your application
* Milestone 5: Using AI responsibly
