## Build an API for Water Consumption Tracking

## Workshop Source 

[Build an API for Water Consumption Tracking, from the .NET Conf Student Zone 2022 Event](https://github.com/microsoft/dotnetconf-studentzone/tree/main/Add%20a%20backend%20to%20your%20website)

## Stage 1: Desired Results 

1. Students will be skilled at:
   1. Transforming a CSV into database tables
   2. Understand what an API is and what it should contain (Routes, Data Source, Authentication, Logging)
   3. Creating an API to serve data from a database
   4. Deploying an API to the cloud

2. Students will be able to independently use their learning to:
   1. Use ORM (object relational mapping) to manage a database
   2. Define databases as code
   3. Create their own APIs 
   4. Integrate their APIs with their data sources

## Stage 2: Evidence
 
1. Create an API for a dataset 
2. [Tutorial Build a web API with minimal API, ASP.NET Core, and .NET 6](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/build-web-api-minimal-api/?WT.mc_id=academic-78652-leestott)
3. [Documentation: Create a minimal web API with ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/tutorials/min-web-api?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=visual-studio?WT.mc_id=academic-78652-leestott)
