# Introduction to Git, GitHub, and Version Control

## Goals

In this workshop, we will discuss the concept of version control which is the foundation of understanding how Git works then we will install Git, work on a local Git repository, work on a remote GitHub repository, and work on another developer's repository.   

| **Goal**                      | Learn the basics you need to get started with Git and GitHub and apply them practically                            |
