# Part 2: Working with Remotes

While working locally may seem enough for some people sometimes we need to collaborate with others so, this is where a remote place to store our code comes into place, and our remote is GitHub a cloud platform used to share code with others and collaborate on projects.

## Creating a GitHub Repository

1. In the upper-right corner of any page, use the âž• drop-down menu, and select **New repository**.

2. Type a short, memorable name for your repository. For example, "hello-world".

3. Optionally, add a description of your repository. For example, "My first repository on GitHub."

4. Choose a repository visibility. For more information, see "[About repositories](https://docs.github.com/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories#about-repository-visibility)".

5. Select **Initialize this repository with a README**.

6. Select **Create repository**.

## Cloning a Git Repository Locally

1. Above the list of files, select **<> Code**.

2. Copy the HTTPS URL for the repository.

    ![Screenshot of the "Code" dropdown menu. To the right of the HTTPS URL for the repository, a copy icon is outlined in dark orange.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-45942/mw-1440/images/help/repository/https-url-clone-cli.webp)

3. Inside Git Bash, execute the following command replacing the URL with the URL you copied earlier

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/hello-world
    ```

This command:
- takes the path to an existing repository
- by default will create a directory with the same name as the repository 
that's being cloned
- can be given a second argument that will be used as the name of the 
directory
- will create the new repository inside of the current working directory


## Uploading Changes to GitHub and Downloading them

1. Inside Git Bash, execute the following command to change the directory to the newly cloned repository's directory

    ```bash
    cd hello-world
    ```

2. Inside Git Bash, execute the following command to make some changes

    ```bash
    echo "My first sentence on GitHub." > new-file.txt
    ```

3. Inside Git Bash, execute the following command to add the changes

    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

4. Inside Git Bash, execute the following command to add the changes

    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```

5. Inside Git Bash, execute the following command to push the changes to GitHub

    ```bash
    git push
    ```

6. Inside your GitHub repository, make any changes to anyfile you want using GitHub's UI. (For example, edit the *README.md* file)

7. Inside Git Bash, execute the following command to pull the changes from GitHub.

    ```bash
    git pull
    ```

2. In the top-right corner of the page, click **Fork**.
3. Select **Create fork**.
