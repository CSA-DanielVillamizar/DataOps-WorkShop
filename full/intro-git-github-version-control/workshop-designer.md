## Introduction to Git, GitHub, and Version Control

## Stage 1: Desired Results

1. Students will be skilled at using Git to manage their projects and collaborate with others on GitHub.
2. Students will be able to independently use their learning to apply version control concepts on their own projects.

## Stage 2: Evidence

As a result of the workshop, students will have Git installed and configured with GitHub on their local machine. They will also create a local Git repository and apply version control concepts to it. In addition to that, they will create a GitHub repository and clone it locally to make some changes and push it to GitHub again. In the end, they will fork a repo, apply the concepts they learned, and make a pull request.

## Stage 3: Learning Plan

Workshop milestones:
- Learn about Version Control.
- Install and configure Git.
- Create a Git local repository.
- Make changes, add, and commit them.
- Review the repository's history.
- Learn about remotes.
- Create a GitHub repository and clone it locally.
- Make changes and push to GitHub.
- Fork another developer's repository and make a pull request.
