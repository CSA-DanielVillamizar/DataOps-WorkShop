## Predict Future Water Consumption with ML.NET

## Workshop Source 

You can find the full workshop in the [.NET Conf Student Zone 2022 repository](https://github.com/microsoft/dotnetconf-studentzone/tree/main/Using%20IOT%20and%20.NET).

## Stage 1: Desired Results 

Through completing the workshop...

1. Students will be skilled at:
   1. Designing and applying a regression model to a Machine Learning problem
   2. Using ML.NET to create predictions based on historical data

2. Students will be able to independently use their learning to:
   1. Use data visualization
   2. Transform data and prepare it for data modelling
   3. Create their own machine learning experiments

## Stage 2: Evidence
 
1. Students will walk away with a regression model that they can use to predict their future water consumption

## Stage 3: Learning Plan

1. Milestone 1: Import the data into your environment
2. Milestone 2: Explore the data with data visualization
3. Milestone 3: Transform the data and prepare it for modelling
4. Milestone 4: Create a machine learning experiment
