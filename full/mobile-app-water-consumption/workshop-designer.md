## Build a Mobile App to Track Water Consumption

## Workshop Source 

You can find the full workshop in the [.NET Conf Student Zone 2022 repository](https://github.com/microsoft/dotnetconf-studentzone/tree/main/Using%20.NET%20MAUI%20to%20Build%20a%20Mobile%20App).

## Stage 1: Desired Results 

1. Students will be skilled at:
   1. Creating a mobile app given an API that serves data
   2. Displaying historical data in a mobile app

2. Students will be able to independently use their learning to:
   1. Create their own mobile applications
   2. Integrate their applications with an API

## Stage 2: Evidence
 
1. Students will be able to evaluate their understanding through the proper functioning of their project. The project should be able to display historyical data and the user should be able to update this data through their app using the API.

## Stage 3: Learning Plan

1. Milestone 1: Examine the scaffolded project including the Water Consumption API
2. Milestone 2: Setup ViewModels for your code
3. Milestone 3: Consume data from a Water Consumption API
4. Milestone 4: Test your application to display your water consumption data and add more data
