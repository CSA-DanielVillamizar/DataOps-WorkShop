## Detect your Water Consumption with IoT Sensors and .NET

## Workshop Source 

You can find the full workshop in the [.NET Conf Student Zone 2022 repository](https://github.com/microsoft/dotnetconf-studentzone/tree/main/Using%20IOT%20and%20.NET).

## Stage 1: Desired Results 

Letâ€™s build prototype of smart bottle - we need to tell how much water was consumed Where do we start? We need a sensor and something to connect it to.After completing the workshop:

1. Students will be skilled at:
   1. Working with IoT sensors using .NET
   2. Designing IoT projects to fulfill a task
   3. Setting up IoT devices
   4. Creating an app to read data from IoT devices
   5. Analyzing data from an IoT device

2. Students will be able to independently use their learning to:
   1. Plan and architecture other IoT projects
   2. Create .NET applications for their IoT projects
   3. Take the data they collect and analyze it using machine learning techniques. There are some good workshops in this repository that can serve as a starting point for this!

## Stage 2: Evidence
 
1. With a weight sensor and accelerometer, you can accurately detect weight change
2. Your IoT app will accurately detect when you have added or removed water from the glass
3. Your app will automatically detect and log when you move the bottle, refill the bottle, or drink from the bottle

## Stage 3: Learning Plan

For full instructions, follow this link: [Full Instructions](solution/README.md)

1. Setup and connect your I<sup>2</sup>C IoT devices
2. Connect your IoT devices to your PC
3. Design the "smart water bottle"
4. Write the code to detect your water consumption!
   1. Read from the accelerometer and weight sensors
   2. Set up auto-detection to store the timestamp, weight, and acceleration anytime we drink, refill, or move our bottle
